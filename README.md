# Face_recognition
Here this is a simple python program where I have used OpenCV to detect face and eyes.
Here using haarcascade files and openCV we detect the face and eyes. The video from the webcam is converted into black and white images and the processing is done and the final output video is displayed with the help of OpenCV.
